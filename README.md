# Aurora (Webproject 1)

We use AngularJS in our project, so you need to use localhost to preview the page,
if you don't the subpages will not show. We would also like to add that AngularJS
is a purely client side framework. We have not used any serverside technlologies,
the reason it doesn't work without localhost is because of browser security features.  

Here are the emails and passwords used for logging in:
