# Aurora

Hello!

We use AngularJS in our project, so you need to use localhost to preview the page,
if you don't the subpages will not show. We would also like to add that AngularJS 
is a purely client side framework. We have not used any serverside technlologies, 
the reason it doesn't work without localhost is because of browser security features.  

Here are the emails and passwords used for logging in:

student@aurora.no
studentpwd

teacher@aurora.no
teacherpwd

admin@aurora.no
adminpwd

We have included two versions of our page, the working directory, which contains sass and jade files, and the ‘final’ version containing only the necessary files.

The reason for the inclusion of the working directory is so you have the opportunity to see our working file architecture, which also makes it easier for you to review our code.

Kind regards group 3 (Audun Olsen, Christoffer Seljehaug, Aslak Ihle, Håkon Horvei)
